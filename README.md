# Assignment : 2 

I created my portfolio website which contains following files :
1. `index.html`
2. `projects.html`
3. `skills.html`
4. `experience.html`
5. `style.css`
6. `slideshow.js`
7. `top.js`
8. `images folder`

## My Portfolio
This is simply my portfolio website which is cross platform compatible and responsive (will also work fine on mobile screen).

## HTML
There are 4 html pages in my website, which are divided into subdivisions using div tags. All four html pages are connected with a top navigation bar.

## CSS
I have used w3.css framework for styling purpose, font awesome library for icons on my website. I have also used external css i.e. `style.css` for designing layout of all html pages. I have also used Montserrat font in my website.

## JavaScript
I used two external js files i.e. `slideshow.js` (for creating slideshow of my projects in project section) and `top.js` (for creating a button which is used to move to the top section of website)
